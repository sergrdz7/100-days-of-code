### Day 70: June 6, 2016

**Today's Progress**: Completed two simple apps showcasing more React practice.
1. A Shopping-Cart that simply displayed a list of items and updated their props and states on whether or not they were selected. Then added their total and displayed the sum of the selected items in a different component.
2. A simple timer that displayed how long you were in the current page in seconds. Good practice of the Date() methods and also on updating states with other methods.
3. Began learning about react-router, how to link to different components and setting their Route by using Link and the two properties that must be passed: path and component. Don't forget about calling the children where necessary! this.props.children


**Thoughts:**: A lot of React learning in the past couple of days but really enjoying the learning process so far. React-router is still a bit confusing but with more practice I hope it becomes clearer on how to use it.

### Day 85: June 29, 2016

**Today's Progress**: Managed to get the Github app to retrieve information from the API. Will handle the data with different components. One to search for a user, another that displays the profile, and one to authenticate the user.

### Day 86: June 30, 2016

**Today's Progress**: Worked on the profile component of the app. It will be able to display a Github's user data such as how many repositories they have, followers, and how many following. This is the final part of the app. It can use some improvement but I'll stick to the basic concepts and move on to the next project.

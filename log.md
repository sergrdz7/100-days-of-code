### Day 70: June 6, 2016

**Today's Progress**: Completed two simple apps showcasing more React practice.
1. A Shopping-Cart that simply displayed a list of items and updated their props and states on whether or not they were selected. Then added their total and displayed the sum of the selected items in a different component.
2. A simple timer that displayed how long you were in the current page in seconds. Good practice of the Date() methods and also on updating states with other methods.
3. Began learning about react-router, how to link to different components and setting their Route by using Link and the two properties that must be passed: path and component. Don't forget about calling the children where necessary! this.props.children


**Thoughts:**: A lot of React learning in the past couple of days but really enjoying the learning process so far. React-router is still a bit confusing but with more practice I hope it becomes clearer on how to use it.

### Day 84: June 28, 2016

**Today's Progress**: Starting a full-app Github Viewer using react, auth0, and react-bootstrap. The app will retrieve a Github user information using Githubs API. Made a basic skeleton using Create-react-app.

### Day 85: June 29, 2016

**Today's Progress**: Managed to get the Github app to retrieve information from the API. Will handle the data with different components. One to search for a user, another that displays the profile, and one to authenticate the user.

### Day 86: June 30, 2016

**Today's Progress**: Worked on the profile component of the app. It will be able to display a Github's user data such as how many repositories they have, followers, and how many following. This is the final part of the app. It can use some improvement but I'll stick to the basic concepts and move on to the next project.

### Day 88: July 3, 2016

**Today's Progress**: Got the Youtube player working. Learning how to use youtube's API. The app is supposed to return a number of iframes with youtube videos depending on the channelID provided.

### Day 89: July 4, 2016

**Today's Progress**: Finished the Youtube Player, not the best app but got some more practice on React concepts. Also goint through the last tutorial of the react course about Redux and the redux cycle:
Step 1: create store: reducer and state
Step 2: Reducer must include: state and action
Step 3: Subscribe: store.subscribe()
step 4: Dispatch

### Day 90: July 4, 2016

**Today's Progress**: A lot of trial and error trying to deploy a react app using create-react-app and Github pages. Also after finishing the short react course I'll be diving back into Freecodecamp's advance front-end projects.

### Day 91: July 6, 2016

**Today's Progress**: started looking on dribble for a nice calculator design.

### Day 92: July 7, 2016

**Today's Progress**: Trying to decide if making the app in react would be a feasible option, and if so what would be the best way to divide the app into components.

**Thoughts:**:

### Day 93: July 8, 2016

**Today's Progress**: Creating simple sketch of calculator. Divided the calculator UI into different components, some might change as I build the app but it gives me a good starting point.

**Thoughts:**:

### Day 94: July 9, 2016

**Today's Progress**: Did a couple of tutorials using flexbox which I'll be using to arrange UI of the calculator. Also came across the styled-components library, read the documentation and I'll also be using it to style the calculator.

**Thoughts:**:

### Day 95: July 11, 2016

**Today's Progress**: Began with create-react-app to create the fcc-calculator to get started. Began by setting up a hierarchy of styled components purely to establish the UI of the app. Added a display grid, and a button grid using flex box. Read that is best to keep styling components separate from the components used to handle the data and logic of the app so I will try to apply this practice.

### Day 96: July 12, 2016

**Today's Progress**: Created necessary styling components. Every styled components can now be imported onto any react component and it will have the styles specified.

### Day 97: July 14, 2016

**Today's Progress**: Finished the basic UI layout by trail and error using flexbox along with styled components.

### Day 97-99: July 15, 2016

**Today's Progress**: Spent most of the time implementing the logic. Lots of of updating state and passing props from component to another but got stuck. I ended up simplifying the app by reducing the number of react components used and instead had one Calculator component where all the logic would be implemented. Lots and lots of frustration on these days but ended up finding a good example online that provided some guidance.

### Day 100: July 17, 2016

**Today's Progress**: Spent time doing some refactoring. App didn't turn out as planned but still implemented all of FCC's requirements. Now to deploy the app on Github pages and that will do it for my first round of 100 DAYS OF CODE!!!  

**Thoughts:**: Some lessons learned:
1. It's good to have something planned ahead for what you'll be working on next if not you'll find yourself wasting time trying to figure out what to do next.
2. Most projects took longer than expected.
3. There were days were frustration gets the best of you and you make little to no progress. Just remember there's always the next day!
4. Didn't meet all my goals but I did learn a lot but most importantly made it a habit to actually sit, code, and help others along the way.

##### (delete me or comment me out)

**Today's Progress**: Fixed CSS, worked on canvas functionality for the app.

**Thoughts**: I really struggled with CSS, but, overall, I feel like I am slowly getting better at it. Canvas is still new for me, but I managed to figure out some basic functionality.
